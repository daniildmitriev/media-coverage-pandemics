**Efficiency of WHO's communication during pandemics**

In this work we analyzed how the tone and the nature of the tweets evolve during the pandemic. Nowadays Twitter is the major source of information for majority of the population and is widely used not only by individual users, but also by major media companies and world organizations. By looking at the tweets of news organizations, WHO and regular users, and compare the data for the H1N1 outbreak with today's Covid-19 outbreak, we can see the changes in how these news are perceived and what effect do they have.
